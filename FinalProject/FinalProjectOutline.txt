Comments: This looks great. The only question I have is the data acqusition side. If you have trrouble collecting the data you might try here:

NFL In Game Classification Model

Goal: To design a classification model that can accurately predict a number of different criteria about each team playing. Specifically I want to predict:
(1) First or last place team.
(2) If a particular coaching style (west coast offense, etc.) can be predicted from the types of plays.
(3) Who will win the game
(4) What types of plays will the team call in future situations (1st and 10, 3rd and long etc.)
(5) Play type variety (sides of the field, run/pass)

Reasoning for model design:
The model will provide useful insight into coach�s decision making, and may be able to define the differences between successful and unsuccessful ones. This will provide insights to leadership decision and to what extent leadership separates winners from losers.

Research:
I�m sure NFL teams have conducted some similar analyses, but I have not seen any of yet. I will continue to research. Most of the analyses I�ve seen on NFL network and on blogs rely on qualitative insight. I�m looking to determine if there is something structural to how certain coaches call plays and if that can be predicted. If certain teams are more unpredictable than others it could be used in game planning.

Dataset:
My dataset will be created by scraping the website Pro-football-reference.com
The site has play by play logs of all NFL games. I will provide a unique identifier for each team (home/away) and game.  I will acquire using a web scraper similar to the one used for the yahoo finance data. The site allows for CSV exports.
Features: 
Score, time, Play description, down, location, yards to go, quarter
Features to engineer: 
Run/pass, outside/inside, Deep/short, time between plays, trailing/ahead, complete/incomplete pass, field position.

Pitfalls:
I am going to explore a number of different avenues don�t have a clear outcome I expect to find. I expect my final model will come through exploration of the features in my dataset. There is a chance my findings will only determine that players not coaches are the determinant in a teams success.
